This code implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow to detect liver disease. The CNN architecture consists of several layers, including convolutional layers with activation functions, max pooling layers, and dense layers. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and the binary cross-entropy loss function.

The code also includes sections for data preprocessing, where you can prepare your training and test data by resizing, normalizing, and applying other necessary transformations. The model is trained using the fit function with the specified number of epochs and validation data. After training, the model is evaluated on the test data to calculate the test accuracy.

Finally, the trained model is saved as an HDF5 file for future use. This code serves as a starting point for building a liver disease detection system based on CNNs, allowing you to train and evaluate the model and save it for later inference on new data.
